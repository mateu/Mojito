=head1 Methods

=head2 create

Create a list of document ids in the collection named 'collection'.
The funny name is due to the fact we're storing document ids from
the notes collection in individual documents of the collection collection.
i.e. we are creating (ordered) sets of documents identified with
a document name.

The motivation for collections of docs collection is so that we can group 
documents together form display purposes.  Form example, say I'm working 
on a project with multiple documents.  I'd like to be able to "identify/tag" 
them to the project so I can narrow my viewing focus to just those documents.

sub create {
    my ( $self, $params ) = @_;

    # We don't need to store the form submit value
    delete $params->{collect};
    my $page_ids = $params->{collected_page_ids};
    
    # NOTE: The $page_ids input can come in two different forms: 
    # - String:   "$page_id1,$page_id2,...$page_id_n";
    # - ArrayRef: [$page_id1,$page_id2,..., $page_id_n];
    $params->{collected_page_ids} = [split ',', $page_ids] if (!ref($page_ids));
    
    # add save time as last_modified and created

Get all pages in the notes collection.
Returns a MongoDB cursor one can iterate over.

=head2 BUILD

Set the collection we want to work with.
In this case it's the collection named 'collection'.
It's a bit meta is why the funny naming.
